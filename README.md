# Introduction 
The telecom industry is incredibly competitive, making it essential for companies to keep their customers happy and loyal to ensure long-term success. This report dives deep into the issue of customer churn, analyzing historical data to uncover patterns, trends, and the main reasons why customers leave. The goal is to provide practical insights that can help reduce churn and boost customer satisfaction.

# Main Goals
- **Understand why customers leave:** Explore patterns and behaviors that drive customer churn.

- **Pinpoint key factors:** Look at how things like demographics, services, and payment methods impact churn.

- **Measure the financial impact:** Calculate how much revenue the company is losing due to churn.

- **Improve customer experience:** Use the findings to boost satisfaction and build long-term loyalty.

 # Data Analysis Methodology and Strategy
 We imported a rich dataset from a fictional telecom company into Power BI. This dataset included customer demographics, service details, and churn metrics.

We then created custom fields to calculate important metrics like churn rate, revenue loss, and high-risk churn categories. This helped us better understand the data and uncover key insights. 


# Finding and Discovery
